Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.


Advantages of Java Multithreading :
1) It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.

2) You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.

3) Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.


Multitasking :
1.Process based (multiprocessing)
2.Thread based (multithreading)


What is Thread in java :
A thread is a lightweight subprocess, the smallest unit of processing. It is a separate path of execution.

Threads are independent. If there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads. It uses a shared memory area.

JAVA THREAD CLASS IS USED IN MULTITHREADING :

Thread class extends Object class and implements Runnable interface.

Commonly used Constructors of Thread class:

Thread()
Thread(String name)
Thread(Runnable r)
Thread(Runnable r,String name)


Life cycle of a Thread (Thread States)
In Java, a thread always exists in any one of the following states. These states are:

New
Active
Blocked / Waiting
Timed Waiting
